Unity Pro, Unity Plus and Unity Personal Software Additional Terms

**Last Updated February 21, 2018**

Your use of the Unity Software is subject to these Additional Terms (the
“**Software Terms**”), which supplement and are incorporated into the [Unity
Terms of Service](https://unity3d.com/legal/terms-of-service).  By downloading,
installing or using the Unity Software in any manner, you represent and affirm
that you have read, understand and agree to be legally bound by and comply with
these Software Terms.  If you do not agree with these Software Terms, you are
not authorized to use the Unity Software in any manner.

**Tier Eligibility**

You and everyone using the Unity Software on your behalf must be Tier Eligible
at all times.  “**Tier Eligible**” means that your Total Finances cannot exceed
the defined Financial Thresholds for the tier of Unity Software you (or those
providing services to you) are using.  Tier Eligibility is measured for the most
recent twelve (12) month period.  If you are mid-project, and your Total
Finances grow to exceed the Financial Threshold of the Unity Software tier you
are using, you do not need to start from scratch - you can simply upgrade your
license and continue working. How we measure your Total Finances varies based on
who you are.  Financial Thresholds are shown in US currency and your Total
Finances will be converted to US currency to determine your Tier Eligibility.

**Total Finances are measured like this:**

-   if you are a Legal Entity using the Unity Software (other than to provide
    services to someone else), your Total Finances are your gross revenues
    and/or funding (no matter what the source), or, if you are a Not-for-Profit
    Entity, your budget for the entire entity (not just the department using the
    Software),

-   If you are an individual or a Legal Entity providing services to a third
    party, your Total Finances is deemed to be your customer or client’s Total
    Finances, and

-   if you are an individual using the Unity Software, but not providing
    services to a third party, your Total Finances are the amount generated in
    connection with your use of the Unity Software. In this case, your Total
    Finances would not include amounts you generate from other work (for
    example, if your day job is as a zookeeper).

By using the Unity Software, you represent and warrant that you are Tier
Eligible to use the tier of Unity Software you are using and those being used on
your behalf.  You understand that it is your responsibility to maintain complete
records establishing your Tier Eligibility and you bear the burden of proving
your Tier Eligibility if we ask.    

**Financial Thresholds for Unity Personal, Unity Plus and Unity Pro:**

-   The Financial Threshold for Unity Personal is US \$100,000 for the most
    recent twelve (12) month period.  To be Tier Eligible to use Unity Personal,
    your Total Finances may not exceed US \$100,000.  If your Total Finances
    exceed US \$100,000 you may not use Unity Personal at all, even for internal
    projects or prototyping.   

-   The Financial Threshold for Unity Plus is US \$ 199,000 for the most recent
    twelve (12) month period. To be Tier Eligible to use Unity Plus, your Total
    Finances may not exceed US \$199,000.  If your Total Finances exceed
    \$199,000, you may only use Unity Pro.

-   There is no Financial Threshold for Unity Pro. You do not need to be Tier
    Eligible to use Unity Pro; Unity Pro may be used by anyone who pays the
    applicable subscription fees.

**No Mixing or Co-mingling:**

Unity Software tiers with different Financial Thresholds may not be used at the
same time by one entity or individual or for or on behalf of one entity or
individual.  You must upgrade all licenses if your Total Finances exceed a
Financial Threshold. Unity reserves the right to disable your use of the Unity
Software if you attempt to use two tiers simultaneously. If you are using Unity
Pro and want to provide services to a customer or client who is Tier Eligible to
use Unity Plus, contact us and we will give you an exception.

Unity may monitor your compliance with and enforce these restrictions and
requirements, including but not limited to monitoring the number of downloads of
your Project Content, and any available revenue estimate data.

Unity Personal users may be required to complete a user survey in order to
activate the Unity Software.

**1. Rights to use the Unity Software.**

**1.1 Use Rights.**

Conditioned upon your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and payment of all applicable subscription fees, Unity grants you (or your
Designated User, defined below) a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free
license: (a) to install and execute the executable form of the Unity Software,
solely for internal use by a single person to develop your Project Content
during the applicable term; and (b) if you are using a version of the Unity
Software other than an educational version, to distribute the runtime portion of
the Unity Software, on a royalty-free basis, solely as embedded or incorporated
into your Project Content and solely to third parties to whom you license or
sell your Project Content pursuant to an agreement that is no less protective of
Unity and its licensors as this Agreement. If you are acting on behalf of a
Legal Entity, you may allow affiliated entities or third party contractors who
are testing, developing and operating your Project Content on your behalf (each,
a “Designated User”), to exercise your rights under 1.1(a) and 1.1(b) on your
behalf, in which case you remain responsible for such Designated Users’
compliance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement or any breach thereof,
including compliance with the restrictions above. Additionally, you may allow
distributors who are licensing or selling your Project Content pursuant to an
agreement that is no less protective of Unity and its licensors as this
Agreement to exercise your rights under 1.1(b) on your behalf.  You may not
otherwise allow third parties to use the rights granted under clauses 1.1(a) and
1.1(b).

**1.2 Copies of Unity Products.**

You (and your Designated Users) may install the Unity Software on both a primary
and a secondary computer or operating system, solely for your convenience, but
only for use by a single person. You may make a single copy of the Unity
Software solely for backup or archival purposes. For the sake of clarity, you
(or your Designated User) may only use one installation at any given time. Unity
may in its sole discretion authorize you to install the Unity Software on
additional computers or operating systems upon deactivation of the Unity
Software installed on existing computers.

**1.3 Unity Console Add-on Developer Requirements.**

Use of the Unity Software with certain console platforms is subject to the Unity
Console Add-on Developer Requirements as set forth on the Unity website. The
license keys to enable certain Unity Software console add-ons may be distributed
by the console manufacturer.

**1.4 Third Party Software.**

The Unity Software incorporates or is bundled with Third Party Software governed
by separate terms, including open source licenses. Such Third Party Software
terms are identified in the LEGAL.TXT file bundled with the Unity Software and
incorporated into this Agreement by reference. You agree that you have reviewed
and accepted those terms and that your use of the Unity Software will be deemed
acceptance thereof.

**2. Restrictions.**

**2.1 Unity Software Tier Restrictions.**

You acknowledge and agree that, as an express condition to the rights granted
under Section 1, you (and those using the Unity Software on your behalf or in
order to provide services to you): (i) may only use one (1) Unity Software tier
at a time (e.g., if you purchase a subscription to use Unity Pro, then you and
those working on your behalf may only use Unity Pro licenses on your behalf);
and (ii) are not permitted to combine or integrate any of your Project Content
developed with one tier of the Unity Software with any of your Project Content
developed simultaneously with another tier.  For the avoidance of doubt: (a) if
you are Tier Eligible to use Unity Personal, you may commence a project using
only Unity Personal and subsequently upgrade all (but not less than all) of your
seats to Unity Plus (if you are Tier Eligible to do so) or Unity Pro; and (b)
any user of the Unity Software may use content properly acquired from the Unity
Asset Store regardless of the tier of Unity Software that was used to develop
such Asset Store content.  You acknowledge and agree that Unity may tag your
Project Content with an identifier to prevent any such unauthorized combination
of your Project Content.

**2.2 Educational Product Restrictions.**

If you are using an educational version of the Unity Software, your right to use
the Unity Software and distribute the runtime portion of the Unity Software in
your Project Content is limited to educational, non-commercial purposes.  Unity
may include a watermark designating that your Project Content was created using
the education version of the Unity Software.  

**2.3 Embedded Software Restriction.**

You may not directly or indirectly distribute your Project Content installed on
more than 1,000 electronic devices or systems if your Project Content provides
the user interface or primary functionality of such electronic device or system
without a separate license from Unity. This restriction does not prevent you
from distributing your Project Content pre-installed on personal computers and
consumer electronic devices such as mobile phones, tablets, televisions or set
top boxes as long as your Project Content does not provide the user interface or
primary functionality of such device.

**2.4 Streaming and Cloud Gaming Restrictions.**

You may not directly or indirectly distribute the Unity Software, including the
runtime portion of the Unity Software, or your Project Content (if it
incorporates the runtime portion) by means of streaming or broadcasting so that
any portion of the Unity Software is primarily executed on or simulated by a
server and transmitted over the Internet or other network to end user devices
without a separate license from Unity. This restriction does not prevent end
users from remotely accessing your Project Content from an end user device that
is running on another end user device.  You may not use a third party to
directly or indirectly distribute or make available, stream, broadcast (through
simulation or otherwise) any portion of the Unity Software unless that third
party is authorized by Unity to provide such services.  

**2.5 Gambling Restriction.**

You may not distribute or publish any of your Project Content in connection with
any Gambling Activities without a separate license agreement from Unity.

**2.6 General Restrictions.**

Except as expressly specified in this Agreement, you may not: (a) copy (except
in the course of loading or installing) or modify or create derivative works of
the Unity Software; (b) distribute, transfer, sublicense, lease, lend, rent or
otherwise provide access to the Unity Software to any third party; (c) directly
or indirectly make the functionality of the Unity Software available to multiple
users or third parties through any means, including but not limited to by
uploading the Unity Software to a network or file-sharing service or through any
hosting, application services provider, service bureau, software-as-a-service
(SaaS) or any other technology or service; (d) use the Unity Software for
competitive analysis or to develop a competing product or service; or (e) do
anything that could cause or result in the Unity Software (including the runtime
portion thereof) being subject to any open source license (or similar license)
that requires as a condition of use, modification or distribution that the Unity
Software (including the runtime portion thereof) or other software combined or
distributed with the Unity Software be: (i) disclosed or distributed in source
code form; (ii) licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or (iii)
redistributable at no charge. You acknowledge and agree that portions of the
Unity Software, including but not limited to the source code and the specific
design and structure of individual modules or programs, are confidential and
constitute or contain trade secrets of Unity and its licensors. Accordingly, you
agree not to disassemble, decompile, modify or reverse engineer the Unity
Software, in whole or in part, or permit or authorize a third party to do so,
except to the extent such activities are expressly permitted by this Agreement
or by law notwithstanding this prohibition. Notwithstanding the restriction
prohibiting decompiling in the immediately preceding sentence, you may decompile
the Unity Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) assemblies solely to inspect
their functionality for purposes of understanding or improving performance of
your Project Content or any editor extension to the Unity Software.

**3. Consent to Data Collection; Privacy Policy Obligations.**

**3.1 Data Collection**

You acknowledge and accept Unity's privacy policy. You agree that the Unity
Software (including the Unity runtime in your Project Content) may send data to
Unity to: (a) check for Unity Software updates; (b) provide aggregated usage
statistics of your use of the Unity Software and the use of your Project Content
by end users; (c) provide optional Developer Services; and (d) validate seats in
order to prevent unauthorized use. You acknowledge and agree that Unity may
deliver messages and contact you about the Unity Software and other Unity
product and service offerings.

**3.2 Obligations**

You agree, and will ensure by obtaining all required consents in accordance with
applicable law, that Unity has the right to receive, collect, retain and use

policy](https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy), which may be updated from
time to time.

**4. Support.**

You may access the online forums and the Unity Answers knowledge base through
the Site. You may also email support\@unity3d.com for assistance with your
seats. Technical support may be offered by Unity at its sole discretion as
described on the Unity website. You acknowledge and agree that Unity has no
obligation under this Agreement to provide patches, updates, new releases or new
versions of the Unity Software.

**5. Term.**

Subscription based seats for Unity Pro and Unity Plus will remain in effect for
the initial subscription period (which has a minimum commitment of 12 months),
and thereafter such seat will automatically renew on a month-to-month basis at
the then-current list price, unless you renew the subscription for a new
subscription term or terminate and cancel it as described on the Site. For
clarity, subscription based seats for Unity Pro and Unity Plus are not
cancelable during the applicable subscription term and are non-refundable. Upon
termination, you must at Unity’s option either promptly delete and destroy or
return to Unity all copies of the Unity Software in your possession or control.

Paid in full, perpetual seats will remain in effect unless earlier terminated in
accordance with the Agreement.

**6. U.S. Government Rights.**

The Unity Software and computer software documentation (“**Documentation**”) are
“commercial items” as that term is defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation
(“**FAR**”) 2.101, consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial
computer software documentation,” respectively, as such terms are used in FAR
12.212 and DFARS 227.7202. If acquired by or on behalf of a civilian agency, the
U.S. Government acquires or will acquire the Unity Software and/or Documentation

its successors. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and
supersedes, any other FAR, DFARS, or other clause or provision that addresses
Government rights in computer software or technical data.

**7. Export Law.**

You agree to comply fully with all export laws and regulations to ensure that
neither the Unity Software nor any technical data related thereto nor any direct
